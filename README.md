# Deals Provider System

Application for creating and managing deals, with fake user registration system.

## About

This app was bootstrapped by [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and used [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management, [Reac Router 4](https://reacttraining.com) for navigation logic, and [Redux Thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk) for asynchronous dispatching. The UI was built with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

 *This app is part of Bahr's interview only, and not ready for production*
